The file 'ruffed_grouse_point_counts' contains records of ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) detections during avian point count surveys in Pennsylvania in 2020 [1]. See Parker et al 2020 [1] for a description of the study site, study design, and point count protocol. 

In this table, each observed individual is recorded as a separate column. Surveys without any detections do not contain any rows.
