## Ruffed grouse automated detection in OpenSoundscape

This repository contains a notebook demonstrating how to use the python packge [OpenSoundscape](opensoundscape.org) to detect ruffed grouse (*Bonasa umbellus*) in audio recordings. It is associated with an article in review in the Wildlife Society Bulletin (Lapp et al 2022). The Jupyter notebook reproduces the evaluation of the recognition method on a validation set. It could also be used to analyze new audio data with minor adaptations. 

The audio data and annotations used in the notebook are available on Dryad ([doi:10.5061/dryad.hdr7sqvmc](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hdr7sqvmc)). However, this notebook can also be run without downloading the data by using the labels and pre-computed outputs of the model, which are included in this repository. 

A description of the automated recognition method can be found in the manuscript.
